<title>Surge vs GitHub Pages</title>

<h1><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> vs <a href="https://surge.sh/" target="_blank">Surge</a> for Launching Static Sites</h1>

<h2 class="heading">Comparing the two:</h2>

<p>I recently joined the team that builds Surge as a practicum student and was tasked with comparing the first-run workflow of launching a static web application through Surge vs GitHub Pages. I'm relatively new to web development and this was my first time downloading and installing Node.js. I had previously dabbled with PHP on the backend and JavaScript on the front-end.</p>
<p>My launches have always been through FTP by going through the cPanel of my hosting provider so launching through the terminal was a new approach for me. To give some context, my experience with the terminal has been collaborating with classmates at school, pulling and pushing from our group projects based on GitHub.</p>
<p>In doing this comparison I created a list that could act as a tutorial based on the GitHub Pages and Surge documentation, respectively. I found that <a href="https://surge.sh/" target="_blank">Surge</a> has separated itself by simplifying the process as a dedicated CDN through the terminal.</p>

<h3 class="heading heading-small">Steps for GitHub Pages:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>First off open up your browser</li>
	<li>Go to github.com</li>
	<li>Create an account</li>
	<li>Once you have an account, log in on github.com</li>
	<li>Then you will need to <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">install</a> the latest version of Git (though you may already have a suitable version)</li>
	<li>After installing, open up your Terminal</li>
	<li>Run the command: <code>git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"</code></li>
	<li>Run the command: <code>git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"</code></li>
	<li>Open your web browser</li>
	<li>Go to github.com</li>
	<li>Create a new repository</li>
	<li>Open up your Terminal</li>
	<li><code>cd path/to/myproject</code></li>
	<li><code>git init</code></li>
	<li><code>git add .</code></li>
	<li><code>git commit -m "my first commit"</code></li>
	<li><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:me/my-project.git</code></li>
	<li><code>git checkout -b gh-pages</code></li>
	<li>Enter your GitHub credentials</li>
	<li><code>git push origin gh-pages</code></li>
</ol>



<h3>Steps for Surge:</h3>


	<ol>
		<li>Open web browser</li>
		<li>Download and Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a></li>
		<li>Open up your Terminal</li>
		<li>Install surge by running: <code>npm install --global surge</code></li>
		<li>launch project by running: <code>surge path/to/myproject myproject.surge.sh</code></li>
		<li>Enter credentials to create an account or login to Surge</li>
	</ol>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>I found that after reading the docs the implementation was relatively straight forward for Surge after downloading and installing node.js. The commands require a file path to your project and a domain name for an initial launch. Whether that is a subdomain of surge.sh or linking to your custom domain through a CNAME file. Surge prompts you for an e-mail and password to protect you from other users launching to that domain.</p> 
<p> GitHub Pages requires a lot more work for a new user to setup the connection between Git and GitHub including authenticating through an SSH key and setting up GitHub Pages branches. This would be a deterrent for some novice web developers who are using a CDN to launch their first project.</p> 
<p>Surge still works with Git and will ignore your .git directory by default. It also allows you to ignore any other files if you specify them in the '.surgeignore' file. Those files won't touch Surge's servers. Overall, having a simple terminal based launch in 3 steps is what gives Surge the edge for launching static sites for free. I would recommend giving both a try to see which system you prefer. I personally had a much better experience launching on Surge.</p>
